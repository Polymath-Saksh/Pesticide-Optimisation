# Pesticide Optimization using Reinforcement Learning

This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to optimize pesticide usage in agriculture. The goal is to find an optimal policy that maintains crop health while minimizing environmental impact from pesticide use.

## Features

- **Custom Environment**: Simulates an agricultural setting with crop health, pest levels, and weather conditions.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agents**: Implements multiple RL algorithms, including Monte Carlo, Q-Learning, SARSA, and N-Step TD.
- **Performance Analysis**: Compares the performance of different RL algorithms.
- **Visualization**: Provides learning curves, performance comparisons, and reward breakdowns.
- **Statistical Testing**: Includes statistical significance testing and policy interpretability analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Polymath-Saksh/Pesticide-Optimization.git
   cd Pesticides_RL
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the notebook in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   code pesticide_rl_notebook.ipynb
   ```

   ```bash
